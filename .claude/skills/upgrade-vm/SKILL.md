description: Upgrade an IV exe.dev VM's software layer by re-provisioning it in place at a newer iv-image commit (no recreate, no disk wipe). Falls back to a full destroy/recreate only when a fresh disk or a base change is actually required.
---

# Upgrade VM

IV VMs run **stock `boldsoftware/exeuntu`** (which keeps Shelley) and get their
tooling from `provision-iv.sh` in the `iv-image` repo. So "upgrading" a VM is
normally just **re-running the provisioner at a newer commit** — in place, no
recreate, no disk wipe, no tailnet churn.

Full destroy/recreate is now the exception, needed only when you genuinely want a
fresh disk or the exe.dev-managed base has changed in a way re-provisioning can't
pick up.

## Path A — Re-provision in place (default)

The user provides the **VM name** and optionally a **target tag/sha** of the
`iv-image` repo (defaults to the latest on the default branch).

**One SSH command at a time** — never parallel SSH to `*.exe.xyz` or `exe.dev`.

```bash
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 <vm>.exe.xyz "cd ~/iv-image \
  && git fetch --tags --quiet \
  && git checkout --detach <tag-or-sha> \
  && ~/iv-image/provision-iv.sh \
  && ~/iv-image/tests/smoke-provision.sh ~/iv-image"
```

This re-pins tools and re-installs the vendored skills + agent config, and
rewrites `~/iv-provision.lock`. Verify:

```bash
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 <vm>.exe.xyz "cat ~/iv-provision.lock"
```

If `~/iv-image` doesn't exist yet (older VM), clone it first — see `bootstrap.md`.

## Path B — Full destroy + recreate (only when required)

This **wipes the VM's local disk** — it reprovisions, it does not migrate state.
Use only when Path A can't deliver the change.

Run sequentially. **One SSH command at a time.**

### 1. Confirm with the user

This is destructive. Confirm the VM name and that wiping its disk is acceptable.

### 2. Destroy the old VM

Destroy the old VM before creating the replacement. The stale Tailscale node can
still be located by hostname afterward, and must be deleted before the new VM
joins.

```bash
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 exe.dev rm <vm>
```

### 3. Delete the stale Tailscale node

Delete the old node before the replacement joins, otherwise the new VM gets a
`-1` suffix. This workstation-specific path expects the 1Password CLI and the
Industry Vault account. The authorization header is passed through curl config
on stdin rather than exposed in curl's process arguments:

```bash
TS_API_KEY=$(op read "op://Employee/Tailscale - API Key/credential" \
  --account industryvault.1password.com)

curl_with_tailscale_auth() {
  printf 'header = "Authorization: Bearer %s"\n' "$TS_API_KEY" \
    | curl --config - "$@"
}

NODE_ID=$(curl_with_tailscale_auth -fsSL \
  https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/tailnet/-/devices \
  | jq -er --arg hostname "<vm>" \
      '[.devices[] | select(.hostname == $hostname) | .id] | unique | if length == 1 then .[0] else error("expected exactly one matching node") end')

curl_with_tailscale_auth -fsSL -X DELETE \
  "https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/device/$NODE_ID"
unset TS_API_KEY
```

### 4. Remove stale SSH state

```bash
ssh-keygen -R <vm> 2>/dev/null || true
ssh -O exit <vm> 2>/dev/null || true
ssh -O exit <vm>.exe.xyz 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 5. Create the new VM (stock exeuntu — no `--image`)

Use the exe.dev VM tag `iv` so the required integrations are attached. This is
not the provisioning repository release tag.

```bash
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 exe.dev new --name=<vm> --tag=iv
```

If the user specified integrations, attach them:

```bash
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 exe.dev integrations attach <integration> vm:<vm>
```

### 6. Wait for the VM to boot

Wait ~20s, then try one SSH with `ConnectTimeout=30`:

```bash
sleep 20
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 <vm>.exe.xyz echo "VM is up"
```

If it fails, wait 30-60s and try once more.

### 7. Rejoin the tailnet + provision

Use the `join-tailnet` skill, then run the full bring-up from `bootstrap.md`
(attach `github-kylelundstedt-iv-image`, clone, `provision-iv.sh`, then clone the
work repo + `provision-docsite`).

### 8. Verify

```bash
tailscale status | grep <vm>
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=30 <vm>.exe.xyz "cat ~/iv-provision.lock"
```

## SSH discipline

- **One SSH attempt at a time.** Never launch parallel SSH to `*.exe.xyz` or `exe.dev`.
- Wait for each command to complete before starting the next.
- If SSH fails, wait 30-60s before one more attempt.
