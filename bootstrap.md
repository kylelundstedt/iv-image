The canonical end-to-end bring-up for an IV VM. Each step is a distinct layer with
its own ownership — they are orchestrated in order, not merged into one script:

| Step | What                                          | Owned by                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Create a VM from the **IV base image** (keeps Shelley) | `exeslim` repo + exe.dev           |
| 2    | Join the tailnet                              | `join-tailnet` skill                       |
| 3    | Install the **team software layer**           | `provision-iv.sh` (this repo, public)      |
| 4    | Clone the work repo + serve its doc site      | repo integration + `provision-docsite`     |
| 5    | _(optional)_ Personal overlay                 | your dotfiles `install.sh` (separate repo) |

The base image is a **custom** image, and that is deliberate. Earlier revisions
of these docs said IV had to use stock `exeuntu` because a custom image loses
Shelley; it loses Shelley only by default, and
`LABEL exe.dev/install-shelley=true` opts back in
(`ssh exe.dev doc customization`). The IV bases set that label and supply their
own `shelley.socket`/`shelley.service`.

What stays true is the split of responsibilities: the **image** carries the OS
layer, and **`provision-iv.sh`** carries the volatile, version-pinned tools.
exe.dev fixes a VM's image at creation with no way to move a live VM onto a
newer one, so baking the pinned tools would turn every bump into a fleet
recreate. See "Why a script, not a custom image" in `README.md`.

Two bases, one per lane
([`kylelundstedt/exeslim`](https://github.com/kylelundstedt/exeslim)):

| Base | For | Carries |
| ---- | --- | ------- |
| `ghcr.io/kylelundstedt/exeslim-dev` | agent/dev VMs | exeslim + `git jq unzip nginx-light openssh-client libyaml-0-2` + Shelley units |
| `ghcr.io/kylelundstedt/exeslim` | deployment targets | systemd, TLS roots, curl — no toolchain, no Shelley |

Stock `boldsoftware/exeuntu` remains available (omit `--image`) for a
batteries-included box that is not part of the IV fleet.

## 1. Create the VM (IV dev base)

```bash
# Use the immutable <date>.<run>.<attempt> build ID, from the package page.
ssh exe.dev new --name=<vm> \
  --image=ghcr.io/kylelundstedt/exeslim-dev:<date>.<run>.<attempt>

# Step 2 needs this; it is attached per VM, not by tag.
ssh exe.dev integrations attach api-tailscale vm:<vm>
```

## 2. Join the tailnet (on demand)

Run the `join-tailnet` skill (or its commands by hand). The image does not
auto-join; a fresh VM is reachable only over the exe.dev edge until it joins.
See `tailnet.md`.

## 3. Provision the team software layer

Pin by checking out a tag/sha of this repo before running the script.

```bash
ssh <vm>.exe.xyz "git clone https://github.com/kylelundstedt/iv-provision.git ~/iv-provision \
  && git -C ~/iv-provision checkout <tag-or-sha> \
  && ~/iv-provision/provision-iv.sh"
```

`provision-iv.sh` installs DuckDB, Apex (the Markdown and documentation-site
renderer), the cloud CLIs (tigris/rclone; aws/azure/gcloud on demand,
via the `install-cloud-cli` helper), herdr, the
doc-site tools, the team agent config (AGENTS.md, Claude settings, Codex config, MCP
servers), and the vendored skills — no node required — and writes
`~/iv-provision.lock` recording exactly what landed.

## 4. Clone a repo + serve its doc site

```bash
ssh exe.dev integrations attach github-<owner>-<repo> vm:<vm>
ssh <vm>.exe.xyz "git clone https://github-<owner>-<repo>.int.exe.xyz/<org>/<repo>.git ~/<repo> \
  && provision-docsite ~/<repo>"
```

See `consuming.md` for repo-integration and doc-site details.

## 5. Personal overlay (optional)

```bash
ssh <vm>.exe.xyz "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylelundstedt/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash"
```

Personal dotfiles layer on top of the team defaults — they overlay `AGENTS.md`,
add personal MCP servers, and install additional skills. This stays in the
personal dotfiles repo, not here, so the team layer remains user-neutral.

## Upgrading later

To update an existing VM's software layer, re-provision in place — no recreate
needed. See the `upgrade-vm` skill.
